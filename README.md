# üè° Perfect Dwellings - An AI-Powered Real Estate Platform

**Perfect Dwellings** is a full-stack MERN (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js) web application designed to revolutionize the property search experience. It goes beyond a standard real estate marketplace by integrating a suite of powerful AI and Machine Learning models to provide users with intelligent insights, a conversational search experience, and accurate property valuations.

This project showcases a modern, scalable architecture where a primary MERN application communicates with a dedicated Python microservice for handling all AI-related tasks.



## ‚ú® Core Features

### Standard MERN Stack Features

  * **User Authentication:** Secure user sign-up and sign-in using JWT (JSON Web Tokens) and Google OAuth for seamless access.
  * **Property Listings:** Users can create, read, update, and delete property listings with detailed information and image uploads.
  * **Image Management:** Firebase Storage integration for robust, cloud-based image hosting.
  * **Advanced Search & Filtering:** A comprehensive search page that allows users to filter properties by type (sale, rent, land), amenities (parking, furnished), price, and special offers.
  * **Responsive UI:** A clean, modern, and fully responsive user interface built with React and Tailwind CSS, ensuring a great experience on any device.
  * **Dark Mode:** A soothing, user-selectable light and dark mode for enhanced visual comfort.

### üß† AI & Machine Learning Features

  * **AI Price Prediction:** When creating a listing, users can get an instant, AI-powered price suggestion based on a sophisticated XGBoost model trained on a massive dataset of real-world property sales.
  * **Conversational AI Chatbot:** A friendly chatbot assistant, powered by Google's Gemini Pro, that understands natural language. Users can ask it to find properties (e.g., "show me 3 bedroom furnished apartments in Mumbai for sale"), and it will automatically generate the correct search query.
  * **AI Neighborhood Analysis:** The listing detail page features an "AI Neighborhood Analysis" report card. This provides scores for **Family Friendliness**, **Health & Wellness**, and **Connectivity**, generated by an AI model that analyzes various factors from our dataset.
  * **AI Insights Dashboard:** A dedicated dashboard that visualizes the inner workings of our AI models, including a chart of the most important factors the price prediction model considers and a radar chart comparing the lifestyle scores of different neighborhoods.

## üöÄ Getting Started

To get a local copy up and running, follow these simple steps.

### Prerequisites

  * Node.js and npm installed
  * Python and pip installed
  * MongoDB Atlas account (or local MongoDB instance)
  * Firebase project for image storage
  * Google AI Studio API Key (for the chatbot)

### Installation & Setup

1.  **Clone the repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/mern-estate.git
    cd mern-estate
    ```

2.  **Setup the Main Application (MERN):**

      * Navigate to the root directory and install backend dependencies:
        ```bash
        npm install
        ```
      * Navigate to the `client` directory and install frontend dependencies:
        ```bash
        cd client
        npm install
        cd .. 
        ```
      * Create a `.env` file in the root directory and add the following variables:
        ```
        MONGO_URI=your_mongodb_connection_string
        JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret
        GEMINI_API_KEY=your_google_ai_studio_api_key
        ```

3.  **Setup the AI Service (Python):**

      * Navigate to the `ai-service` directory:
        ```bash
        cd ai-service
        ```
      * Create and activate a Python virtual environment:
        ```bash
        python -m venv venv
        source venv/bin/activate  # On Mac/Linux
        .\venv\Scripts\activate  # On Windows
        ```
      * Install the required Python packages:
        ```bash
        pip install -r requirements.txt
        ```
        *(Note: You will need to create a `requirements.txt` file containing pandas, scikit-learn, xgboost, joblib, Flask, and Flask-Cors).*

### Running the Application

This project uses `concurrently` to run all necessary servers with a single command.

1.  **Train the AI Models:** Before the first run, you need to train your models. Navigate to the `ai-service` folder (with the venv active) and run:

    ```bash
    python model_trainer_advanced.py
    python neighborhood_analyzer.py
    ```

2.  **Start All Servers:** From the **root `mern-estate` directory**, run the master dev command:

    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```

    This will start the Node.js backend, the React frontend, and the Python AI service simultaneously. Your application will be available at `http://localhost:5173`.

## ü§ñ About the AI Models

  * **Price Prediction Model:** This is an XGBoost Regressor model trained on the `india_housing_prices.csv` dataset from Kaggle. It uses a sophisticated pipeline to preprocess data and is fine-tuned with GridSearchCV to achieve high accuracy. It predicts property prices based on a wide range of factors including size, location, age, and amenities.

  * **Neighborhood Scoring Model:** This model uses data analysis on the same dataset to generate scores for different lifestyle factors. It calculates an average score for each unique `Locality` based on its amenities, schools, hospitals, and public transport access.

  * **Conversational Chatbot:** This feature uses Google's Gemini Pro model via an API. It is guided by a carefully crafted prompt that instructs it to act as a real estate assistant, capable of both having a natural conversation and extracting structured search parameters from user messages.
